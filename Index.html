<h1>Online Football Club purchases</h1>
<div>Illegal club purchases.</div>
<p>(WARNING: before you buy just know these sites have FIFA watching your every move.)</p>
<p>This site will allow you to buy many different clubs for prices in many different leagues for prices ranging around 20,000$-1,000,000,000. Clubs that are cheap will be highlighted in blue and expensive clubs will be highlighted in yellow. <STRONG>(If you buy any club no one will know, you just get control of the club.)</STRONG> </p>
<h1>HOW IT WORKS:</h1>

<p>We hack FIFA servers and kick the current owner out, then we destroy their network. After-that we kill the servers and let you in. Clubs like PSG will have extra power so it could take months to hack but clubs in unknown leagues take seconds. Another way we do this is bidding on clubs on the dark web with <STRONG>YOUR</STRONG> money and take the club to your account. We also have buddies in Fifa to ensure you have a safe purchase. <strong>VAR and Fouls won't be included in your club.</strong> We also have an insider in the <em>FIFA headquarters</em> and unfortunately we have found out that<strong> YOU WILL BE TRACKED FOR A LIFETIME BY: </strong></p>
